Summary

Our product will be a PC builders Guide website. Our website's objective is to assists people through the complicated process of building their own PC. people who may not have any experience of building a computer can look through our selection of pre-built computers, designed by our staff, at different price points. For those people, we also offer a page that details each component and the different generations that are compatible. A user with slightly more experience can have the chance to look through our vast inventory to design their own PC. Far more experienced individual, or people who have a PC build in mind, have the opportunity to create mock computer builds and post them on our website for others to review.

We wanted to create a website that is user friendly for everyone. Our searching function allows users to search by component name or by component model. Our side bar widgets allow users to narrow their search options to find what they are looking for. the side bar widgets allow users to specify the brand, the price, the rating, and even the generation for components. We also offer information on the prices of the components. Users can directly purchase their drafts once they are satisfied with the build. To battle the constant change in prices for computer components, we want to keep the prices for parts at their MSRP value. 

Users can save up to any number of drafts on their accounts. Even after a draft is saved, a user is free to make any changes to it and re-save it. Once a user starts a draft by choosing a component (RAM, motherboard, GPU, etc..), we narrow their search ability to only parts that are compatible. This is to ensure the user doesn't accidently purchase parts that can't work together. We do this by giving each component a series of tags that detail it's compatibility. Only parts with the same tags can be displayed together in a draft.  

The goal is to create an easy way for people to test their PC ideas without fear of the investment. Users can create their own accounts and save their hypothetical PC build as drafts. They can then post the drafts for others to view if they need help. Other users on the site can visit any public drafts to rate the build and leave a comment on how they feel about it. Our hope is that the comments while range from praising a build to suggesting changes. Our website is designed by the community, for the community.  

OBJECTIVE
